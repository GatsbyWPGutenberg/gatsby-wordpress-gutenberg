Theme gives you these features:

- allows you to write custom React component for each block
- autogenerates the `<Blocks />` component importing only react components that are used in the content, to keep bundle size small
- manages live previews (as you type in gutenberg)

The `Blocks` component can be obtained as a field through graphql query in Gatsby:

```js
import React from "react"
import Layout from "../components/layout"
import { graphql } from "gatsby"

export default function BlogPost({ data }) {
  const post = data.allWpPost.nodes[0]
  console.log(post)
  return (
    <Layout>
      <div>
        <h1>{post.title}</h1>
        {post.Blocks && <post.Blocks />}
      </div>
    </Layout>
  )
}
export const query = graphql`
  query($slug: String!) {
    allWpPost(filter: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {
      nodes {
        title
        Blocks
      }
    }
  }
`
```
