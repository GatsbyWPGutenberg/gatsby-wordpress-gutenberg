description: How does the theme work?

Theme gives you these features:

- allows you to write custom React component for each block
- autogenerates the `<Blocks />` component importing only react components that are used in the content, to keep bundle size small
- autogenerates gatsby pages respecting a template hierarchy
- manages live previews (as you type in gutenberg)

> Read more about how to [write your custom React component](/features/blocks/), how to [customize your generated page](/features/page-templates/) and how the [previews](/features/previews/) work.

Currently there is no easy way to import the `Blocks` component from the user land without knowing its absolute path (the component is generated for each post separatelly).
That's why there is currently no way to opt out from page autogeneration from the content.
However gatsby team is working on features to allow this, so when ready, the theme will be probably split into separate packages.

> The autogenerated files are placed inside `.cache/fragments/gatsby-wordpress-gutenberg` folder.
