To get the core functionality you need to install plugins into wordpress and npm packages into gatsby.

## Dependencies

> The source plugin is based on the new `gatsby-source-wordpress` (v4 - experimental) which uses `wp-graphql` under the hood. However the code was written to be able to support also an older version (v3), which uses WP REST API, if there is a high demand for it.

### gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental

Follow the instructions on the [plugin's repo](https://github.com/TylerBarnes/using-gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental).
