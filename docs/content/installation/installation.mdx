To get the core functionality you need to install plugins into Wordpress and npm packages into gatsby.

## Dependencies

> The source plugin is based on the new `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental` which uses `wp-graphql` under the hood.

### gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental

Follow the instructions on the [plugin's repo](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental).

## Gatsby

- Install the theme with npm / yarn

```sh
npm i gatsby-theme-wordpress-gutenberg
# or
yarn add gatsby-theme-wordpress-gutenberg
```

- Setup theme in your `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ... other plugins
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`,
      options: {
        // configure according to plugin's instructions
      },
    },
    `gatsby-theme-wordpress-gutenberg`,
  ],
}
```

- To setup previews, read the [previews](/features/previews/) section.
