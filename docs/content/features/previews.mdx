title: Previews
---

To enable previews you either need a running instance of `gatsby develop` or a Preview instance running in `Gatsby Cloud`.

## Overview

The preview lifecycle is roughly explained in these steps:

- you define your preview instance url in `wp-config.php`
- `wp-gatsby-gutenberg` creates its own custom wp post type `wgg_preview`, which is exposed through rest api and used when you type new content in the gutenberg editor
- the changes are batched and saved in the database within custom post type above, which has one to one relationship with the edited post
- `gatsby-source-wordpress` then sources these posts as well and the `gatsby-source-gutenberg` resolves the matching.
- the preview page is autogenerated and available from gutenberg
- to let gatsby know that it is out of sync with the newest content, the gatsby instance exposes POST `/___gutenberg/previews/:id` endpoint where wordpress server ssends small notification paylod upon each change in gutenberg

> The autogenerated preview pages use `/___gutenberg/previews/:id` url path
