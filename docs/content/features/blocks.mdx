description: Create your block component
---

You can write your own custom block implementation for each block. Otherwise the default `<UnknownBlock />` component is used which just displays the raw html output of the block.

> You can import default gutenberg's css for blocks `@wordpress/block-library/build-style/style.css` in your project when relying on the unkown block a lot. This way you can get some default styling of the blocks for free.

## Example

To create your own block component:

- create a file with path `src/gatsby-theme-wordpress-gutenberg/components/blocks/[block-name].[ext]` which has the component as its default export
- the file has to contain a graphql fragment definition on the block's graphql type, where you can query for block fields, this fragment will be included in the page component query
- the `innerBlocks` components are passed in as the `children` prop

> The components can be shadowed. That means if multiple themes or your project implement the same block, the last definition wins.

For example for the default `core/quote` block, the file should be created as `src/gatsby-theme-wordpress-gutenberg/components/blocks/core/quote.js`:

> Graphql typename for block type name is camelCased and uses GutenbergBlock suffix, for example: `core/quote` -> `CoreQuoteGutenbergBlock`

```jsx
import React from "react"
import { graphql } from "gatsby"

export const query = graphql`
  fragment Quote on CoreQuoteGutenbergBlock {
    attributes {
      value
    }
  }
`

export default ({ attributes }) => (
  <p style={{ background: `orange` }}>
    <strong>This is a custom implementation of quote block</strong>
    My value is {attributes.value}
  </p>
)
```
