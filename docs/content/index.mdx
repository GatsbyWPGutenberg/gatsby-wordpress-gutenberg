## What is Gutenberg

Gutenberg is the new default WordPress content editor. Gutenberg introduces a block based approach to editing that aims to makes it easier to work with media rich pages and posts.

## What is GatsbyWPGutenberg

GatsbyWPGutenberg is a framework that makes it possible to work with Gutenberg blocks in Gatsby instead of using raw HTML content.

In other words, you can use Gutenberg as a page builder for your Gatsby's content.

## Features

- Render Gutenberg blocks with custom React components
- Live preview in Gatsby and Gutenberg
- Automatic React component generation based on post's content to keep bundle size small

> Consider this software is still in beta.
